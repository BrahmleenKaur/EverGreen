# EverGreen

## Goal:
This project mainly targets to contribute to the betterment of the environment by planting more and more number of trees. Generally in urban areas, there is very little greenery to look around but still enough space is there where plantation can be done. Many times, people think of volunteering (like planting trees), but they do not get proper resources or support to put their thoughts into implementation. These constraints can be proper choice of places where trees should be planted, or proper choice of saplings etc.

These constraints are overcome by our app:
1. People can search spots according to their location which are approved by the admins(or local authorities). 
2. People can order plants through our app free of cost. 
3. Our app also provides basic guidelines on how to plant trees on site.

People can also track the status of the spots, and view their contribution till date on their beautiful dashboard. Other people, who cannot themselves plant trees, can contribute by posting the locations which they find suitable or void of greenery.
